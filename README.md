## 📚 Documentation Structure

We follow the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which separates documentation into **four distinct types**:

| **Section**     | **Use this when…**                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tutorials/`    | You’re guiding a beginner step-by-step through something new. |
| `guides/`       | You’re showing how to accomplish a specific task.             |
| `reference/`    | You’re documenting APIs, specs, or commands.                  |
| `explanations/` | You’re explaining concepts, internals, or design rationale.   |

> 💡 We also organise content into [streams](/streams/), thematic pathways that help users achieve bigger goals across tutorial/guide/explanation boundaries. Use them to orient users, not replace the Diátaxis structure.

## 📦 Style & Naming Conventions

- Say "Bangle.js" for the platform overall.
- Refer to "Bangle.js 2" only when distinguishing between models is important.
- If a doc is hardware-specific, clearly label it (e.g. with callouts or headers).
- Use clear, plain English and second person ("you").
- Keep intros short; prioritise code and examples.

## 🔧 Local Development

| Command        | Action                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install` | Install dependencies                      |
| `pnpm dev`     | Start local dev server (`localhost:4321`) |
