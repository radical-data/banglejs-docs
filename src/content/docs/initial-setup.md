This guide gets your watch fully set up and working — from unboxing to having a clock on your wrist that’s truly yours.

You'll:

- Charge and power on your Bangle.js
- Learn how to use the touchscreen and button
- Connect to the Bangle.js App Loader
- Set the time
- Install or update apps

Whether you're a coder, tinkerer, or just curious — this is your starting point.

## Unbox and Charge

### What's in the box:

- Bangle.js smartwatch
- Magnetic USB charging cable

### Charge it up:

1. Plug the USB cable into your charger or computer.
2. Align the magnetic connector to the back of the watch (it should snap on).
3. A battery icon may appear when charging. A full charge takes \~2 hours.

## Power On and Look Around

### Turn it on:

- **Hold the physical button** (on the right side) until the screen lights up.

### What you'll see:

A clock face like this (your version may vary):

```
┌──────────────────┐
│    14:23     │
│  Wed 3 April │
│   Battery 🔋  │
└──────────────────┘
```

### Try the interface:

You can now press around the screen and try the button.

## Open the App Loader

The **Bangle.js App Loader** runs in your browser. It’s how you install, update, and manage apps on your watch.

👉 Open: **[https://banglejs.com/apps/](https://banglejs.com/apps/)**

You'll need to use a browser that supports Web Bluetooth. Check out this [compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility) for browser support.

## Connect Your Watch

1. Click **Connect** in the App Loader (top right)
2. In the Bluetooth popup:

   - Select **Bangle.js xxxx** (where xxxx is your device ID)
   - Click **Pair** or **Connect**

3. The App Loader will show your firmware version and available storage

## Set the Time

If your watch shows the wrong time, this is the fix:

1. Click the **More** tab
2. Click **Set Bangle.js Time**.

This sets the time to match your computer.

## Install Core Apps

Ensure your clock, launcher, and settings apps are installed and up to date:

1. Click the **More** tab
2. Choose **Install default apps**
3. Click on the **My Apps** tab
4. Click **Update x Apps**

This gives you a clean and working base.

## Add Extra Apps (Optional)

Want more? Explore the **Library** tab.

- Filter by category (Clocks, Games, Tools, etc.)
- Click an app for details
- Click **Install** or the upload icon ⬆️ to install it

## Run Your Apps

On your Bangle.js:

1. Hold the button to open the App Launcher
2. Swipe to find your app
3. Tap to launch

## Troubleshooting

**Can’t connect?**

- Turn Bluetooth off and on again
- Reboot the watch (hold button 6s)
- Refresh the App Loader tab

**Install fails?**
