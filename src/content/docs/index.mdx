## Why Bangle.js?

**Bangle.js** is a fully open source smartwatch powered by [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/). You write apps in JavaScript, deploy with a browser, and shape your watch to fit your life.

This site is here to help you:

- Explore what's possible
- Develop your own apps and tools
- Understand how the system works
- Troubleshoot and extend your watch
